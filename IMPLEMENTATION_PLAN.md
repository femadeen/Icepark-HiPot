# Implementation Plan: Hipot Legacy App Conversion

This document outlines the plan for converting the legacy `Pekasuz3` Windows Forms application to a modern .NET MAUI Blazor application.

## 1. Replicate the UI Panels

The legacy application uses several pop-up panels for user interaction. These have been recreated as reusable Blazor components:

*   **`InputPanel.razor`**: A component to prompt the user for unique ID input.
*   **`MessageBoxPanel.razor`**: A flexible message box component to display information, questions, and errors.
*   **`PassFailPanel.razor`**: A component to clearly display the final PASS/FAIL status of a test.

*Status: Completed*

## 2. Integrate the New Panels

The new UI panels have been integrated into the `ChannelView.razor` component. The logic to show and hide these panels based on the state of the test sequence has been added.

*Status: Completed*

## 3. Implement the Main Form Logic

The main application logic from the legacy `frmMain.vb` has been ported to the new application:

*   **Application Exit:** A safe exit feature with a confirmation prompt has been added to the `NavMenu`.
*   **Menu/Navigation:** "About" and "Logout" options have been added to the `NavMenu`.

*Status: Completed*

## 4. Refactor Event Handling

The event handling logic from the legacy application's `controlevents.vb` has been refactored and moved to the appropriate Blazor components:

*   **`SN_KeyDown`**: The user can now start a test by pressing "Enter" in the serial number field.
*   **Elapsed Time Timer**: An elapsed time counter is now displayed for each channel during a test.
*   **Tab Header Coloring**: The tab headers are now color-coded to indicate the status of each test channel.

*Status: Completed*

## 5. Vital Product Data (VPD)

The legacy application has a timer for "VPD" related tasks. The functionality of this feature is not clear from the available code and documentation.

*Status: Pending - More information needed.*

To implement this functionality, I need more details about what the VPD timer does and what data it is supposed to handle.
